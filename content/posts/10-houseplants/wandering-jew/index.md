Purple Wandering Dude Cuttings. You will receive three fresh, cut to order, Wandering Dude cuttings. Each cutting will be more than 6 inches in length and will contain at least three leaf bunches/nodes for rooting. Upon arrival, put cuttings in water or directly in the soil. If they start to lose their color, give them more light. These plants like bright, indirect light and slightly moist soil. They are $4.95 for three cuttings, buy 9 and get the 10th cutting free!

Plants are mailed via First Class Mail. Orders over $35 come with free shipping! If temps in your area are going to be below 45 degrees, we recommend you consider a heat pack. Heat packs are $4 each, with no mark up after taking shipping into consideration.
