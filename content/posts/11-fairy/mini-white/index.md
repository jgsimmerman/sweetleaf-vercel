<strong>'Mini White' Fittonia albivenis (Argyroneura group)</strong> - Known as "The Silver Nerve Plant" the white fittonia is a spreading tropical evergreen perennial in the Acanthaceae family from Peru. They are non-toxic and fuzzy pet safe, as well as reptile safe. We currently carry these in [Red](/catalog/fairy-garden/mini-red), [White](/catalog/fairy-garden/mini-white) and [Pink](/catalog/fairy-garden/mini-pink). These white-veined nerve plants belong to the Argyroneura Group of Fittonia albivenis. 

'Mini White' Nerve plants produce 1-2” green leaves with a netting of silvery-white colored veins or nerves. Nerve plants bloom in Spring with tiny yellow or white flowers on small spikes, but their vibrant leaves are what put on the real show. The Mini White is a great plant for terrariums and fairy gardens, as houseplants or as bedding, or can be put in a hanging planter and allowed to trail. Plants will spread as ground cover or will trail over the sides of hanging baskets and planters if allowed free reign. Pinching off shoots that grow leggy will encourage the plant to grow fuller and more bushy. Your Mini White will arrive in a 2 inch plastic nursery pot or a 2.5” terra cotta pot for an additional charge. In maturity, plants can grow to be 3 - 12” tall with proper care and will trail or spread up to 18 inches.

The Mini White likes to be indoors when temperatures dip below 55 degrees F. Cold hardy outdoors year round in Zones 10 - 11, in bright shade. Normal room temperature inside is ideal. Plants prefer bright indirect light and don't care for direct sun. Easy to grow, the soil should be kept moist and not allowed to dry out. The Mini White does not like cold water, so allow to sit out until reaching room temperature to avoid shock. Nerve plants get very dramatic when under watered, and the Mini White is no exception. In time they will perk back up if watered. Fertilize weekly with a very weak, balanced fertilizer during the growing season from Spring to Fall. Mist or place on a tray of rocks or pebbles to increase humidity.  [See our care guide for more detailed instructions](/care/fittonia/).

Unboxing Instructions: When plant arrives, pot will be in a bag or wrapped to reduce soil loss. remove paper and packaging materials and cut out of bag or wrapping and water thoroughly. Repot in a peat based soil in a small pot, as Nerve plants have shallow roots. Any leaf tips lost during repotting should be places back into the soil to propagate.
